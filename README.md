# My-Mlops-Project
This project creates an automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to train, evaluate, and deploy machine learning models. Code changes trigger model retraining, followed by evaluation and deployment via a Flask-based REST API. It ensures fast, reliable development and deployment, supporting continuous model improvements.
